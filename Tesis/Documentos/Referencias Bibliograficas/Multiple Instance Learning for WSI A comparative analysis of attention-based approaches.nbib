AB  - Whole slide images (WSI), obtained by high-resolution digital scanning of 
      microscope slides at multiple scales, are the cornerstone of modern Digital 
      Pathology. However, they represent a particular challenge to artificial 
      intelligence (AI)-based/AI-mediated analysis because pathology labeling is 
      typically done at slide-level, instead of tile-level. It is not just that medical 
      diagnostics is recorded at the specimen level, the detection of oncogene mutation 
      is also experimentally obtained, and recorded by initiatives like The Cancer 
      Genome Atlas (TCGA), at the slide level. This configures a dual challenge: (a) 
      accurately predicting the overall cancer phenotype and (b) finding out what 
      cellular morphologies are associated with it at the tile level. To better 
      understand and address these challenges, two existing weakly supervised Multiple 
      Instance Learning (MIL) approaches were explored and compared: Attention MIL 
      (AMIL) and Additive MIL (AdMIL). These architectures were analyzed on tumor 
      detection (a task where these models obtained good results previously) and TP53 
      mutation detection (a much less explored task). For tumor detection, we built a 
      dataset from Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-LUSC) slides, with 349 positive 
      and 349 negative slides. The patches were extracted from 5× magnification. For 
      TP53 mutation detection, we explored a dataset built from Invasive Breast 
      Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) slides, with 347 positive and 347 negative slides. In this 
      case, we explored three different magnification levels: 5×, 10×, and 20×. Our 
      results show that a modified additive implementation of MIL matched the 
      performance of reference implementation (AUC 0.96), and was only slightly 
      outperformed by AMIL (AUC 0.97) on the tumor detection task. TP53 mutation was 
      most sensitive to features at the higher applications where cellular morphology 
      is resolved. More interestingly from the perspective of the molecular 
      pathologist, we highlight the possible ability of these MIL architectures to 
      identify distinct sensitivities to morphological features (through the detection 
      of regions of interest, ROIs) at different amplification levels. This ability for 
      models to obtain tile-level ROIs is very appealing to pathologists as it provides 
      the possibility for these algorithms to be integrated in a digital staining 
      application for analysis, facilitating the navigation through these 
      high-dimensional images and the diagnostic process.
