abstract = {Digital whole slides images contain an enormous amount of information providing a strong motivation for the development of automated image analysis tools. Particularly deep neural networks show high potential with respect to various tasks in the field of digital pathology. However, a limitation is given by the fact that typical deep learning algorithms require (manual) annotations in addition to the large amounts of image data, to enable effective training. Multiple instance learning exhibits a powerful tool for training deep neural networks in a scenario without fully annotated data. These methods are particularly effective in the domain of digital pathology, due to the fact that labels for whole slide images are often captured routinely, whereas labels for patches, regions, or pixels are not. This potential resulted in a considerable number of publications, with the vast majority published in the last four years. Besides the availability of digitized data and a high motivation from the medical perspective, the availability of powerful graphics processing units exhibits an accelerator in this field. In this paper, we provide an overview of widely and effectively used concepts of (deep) multiple instance learning approaches and recent advancements. We also critically discuss remaining challenges as well as future potential.}
